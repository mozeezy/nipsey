# Introducing Nipsey - get an inspirational quote using your voice only!

This project was created using React and Alan Studio on the backend to parse voice commands.

## How to use

Simply click the microphone icon on the bottom right to activate Nipsey and say "Give me the word of the day" or "Give me the quote of the day" once you hear the tone.

## Have Nipsey read the quote for you using your voice!

After the quote is fetched, Nipsey will ask if it can read the quote for you. Simply say "yes" if you wish for the quote to be read to you, or "no" if you don't
