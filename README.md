# Introducing Nipsey - get an inspirational quote using your voice only!

Nipsey is a voice assistant app that gives you a random inspirational quote using your voice only. For this app, I built the front-end using ReactJS and materialUI to assist with styling the page.

The voice commands/dialogue were handled using Alan Studio, which is Alan AI's online web IDE/code editor and is therefore abstracted from the user. To view the code I used to handle voice commands, [go to this gist here](https://gist.github.com/mozeezy/842aa99a31ee10e58ad702b637497440)

## How to use

- Go to: https://nipsey.netlify.app/

- Simply click the microphone icon on the bottom right to activate Nipsey and say "Give me the word of the day" or "Give me the quote of the day" once you hear the tone.

- You can even have Nipsey give you responses to some casual conversations. Try asking: "How old are you?"

- Ask Nipsey other questions from [this script here](https://gist.github.com/mozeezy/015ff93e5b14f6a3238381903b7db76f)

## Have Nipsey read the quote for you using your voice!

After the quote is fetched, Nipsey will ask if it can read the quote for you. Simply say "yes" if you wish for the quote to be read to you, or "no" if you don't.

## To deactivate Nipsey

To stop Nipsey from picking up your voice, just click the microphone icon on the bottom right of the screen to deactivate Nipsey.
